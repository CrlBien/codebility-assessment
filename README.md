# My First Next.js Project

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## My Experience

This is my very first time using Next.js and React. The first three days were challenging as I followed the official [Next.js tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn) to learn the basics. Understanding file-based routing, components, props, state, and styling was harder than I expected.

Despite the difficulties, I’m really proud of what I’ve accomplished. The app works as intended, and even though the styling isn’t perfect, I feel more confident in building React and Next.js projects in the future.

This project has been a great learning experience and a solid first step into modern frontend development.
